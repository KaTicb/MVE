# MVE Project

This repository is dedicated to my lab assignments for the MVE course.

## Summary

The project focuses primarily on temperature distribution and related
algorithms, visualizations, and data files.

## Contents

### Temperature Distribution

`main.cpp`: Contains the C++ code for computing the temperature distribution
algorithms.

### Plot Construction

`main.py`: A Python file for creating 2D plots of temperature distribution and
the relationship of iteration-dependent errors (residuals).

### Data Files

- `dataT.txt`: A text document that contains the temperature distribution data.
- `dataT.bin`: Similar to `dataT.txt`, but the data is stored in binary format
  for more efficient retrieval and storage.
- `dataMDD.bin`: A binary data file that houses information on maximum
  residuals.
